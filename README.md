Problem statement:
Virtual Eye - Life Guard for Swimming Pools to Detect Active Drowning

Abstract:
➢ Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this 
urban lifestyle. 
➢ Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels, and weekend tourist spots.
➢ Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes 
breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident.
➢ Children under six of their age are found to be suffering the highest drowning 
mortality rates worldwide.

  Project Objectives:  
    To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life. 
    By studying body movement patterns and connecting cameras to artificial intelligence (AI) systems we can devise an underwater pool safety system that reduces the risk of drowning.
    So that we can reduce the Mortality rate Worldwide.
